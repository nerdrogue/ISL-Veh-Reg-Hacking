# ISL-VEH-REG-HACKING

This is a multi-platform, multi-threaded Rust tool with an egui-based GUI that finds basic registration info for a given Islamabad registered car's license plate number.

---

## How does this work?
The Islamabad Excise portal requires both a registration number and a registration date to display vehicle information. This tool automates the search by taking a user-defined date range, splitting it into segments, and assigning each segment to a thread. Each thread then systematically queries the API until the correct date is identified. All requests are sent to a publically available server that any one can access.

## Q/A
### Is this illegal? / Is this hacking?
No, the tool can only access publically available data. Hacking involves bypassing security or exploiting vulnerabilities; this tool merely automates a manual process using public interfaces. However, keep in mind that if excessive requests are being sent, it could be interpreted as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.

# DISCLAIMER

**LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND LIABILITY**

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH, AND PERSONAL VERIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT INTERACTS WITH GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN PAKISTAN. USERS MUST BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS UNDER THE PREVENTION OF ELECTRONIC CRIMES ACT (PECA) 2016:

1. **PUBLIC ACCESS AUTHORIZATION:** UNDER PECA SECTION 3 (PROVISO), ACCESS TO DATA IS DEEMED AUTHORIZED IF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM OR DATA IS AVAILABLE FOR OPEN ACCESS BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SINCE THE ISLAMABAD EXCISE VEHICLE VERIFICATION PORTAL IS A PUBLIC-FACING UTILITY, AUTOMATED RETRIEVAL GENERALLY FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF AUTHORIZED ACCESS.
2. **LACK OF CRIMINAL INTENT:** MOST OFFENSES DEFINED UNDER PECA REQUIRE THE PROSECUTION TO ESTABLISH DISHONEST INTENTION. THIS TOOL IS INTENDED FOR DATA TRANSPARENCY, NOT FOR CAUSING WRONGFUL HARM TO THE SYSTEM OR INDIVIDUALS.
3. **SYSTEM INTERFERENCE RISKS:** UNDER PECA SECTION 5, ACTS THAT DISTURB THE NORMAL WORKING OF AN INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE PROHIBITED. USERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT UTILIZING THE MAXIMUM THREAD COUNT (20 THREADS) MAY CAUSE UNDUE STRESS ON GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD BE INTERPRETED AS SYSTEM INTERFERENCE.
4. **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:** BE ADVISED THAT GOVERNMENT DATABASES ARE OFTEN CLASSIFIED AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER PECA (SECTIONS 6, 7, AND 8). INTERFERENCE WITH SUCH SYSTEMS CARRIES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEGAL PENALTIES.

OR TO PUT IT SIMPLY, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE A LOT OF THREADS (WHICH WILL CAUSE MORE REQUESTS, INCREASING SERVER LOAD, AND POSSIBLY CAUSING A DENIAL OF SERVICE), AND/OR USE THIS FOR CRIMINAL PURPOSES (IF YOU DO YOU ARE A JACKASS), YOU WON'T GO TO JAIL.

**USAGE WARNING**

THE AUTHOR OF THIS TOOL ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY MISUSE, LEGAL CONSEQUENCES, OR IP BANS RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THIS CODE. BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH PAKISTANI LAWS, INCLUDING PECA 2016 AND THE PAKISTAN PENAL CODE.

**USE THIS TOOL RESPONSIBLY AND AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
